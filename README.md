# Train your brain

## Introduction

### Project Description

[Train your brain](https://claudiainsweden.github.io/train-your-brain/) is a memory card game with 6 pairs of cards. The matching cards are to be found by flipping two cards and remember which cards are placed where to find matching pairs. When the user has found all matching pairs, the user won and can restart the game if wished.  

### Project Purpose

A memory game is a fun way to train concentration and focus and is suitable for people of all ages.

## Features

### Home

The game consists of one page only including a footer with a Facebook Share button.

### Game area

Beneath the title and welcome text the user can see a total of 12 cards with paw-prints on them.

The user starts the game by flipping the first card to see the animal on the front. When the user clicks on a second card, the cards will be compared with each other. When the cards match, that is if they show the same animal, the cards will remain flipped and stay visible to the user. If the cards don't match, the cards will be unflipped and the user may continue flipping cards to find matches.

The board will lock when two cards have been unflipped to avoid that more than 2 cards can be selected. The flipped cards will be visible for one second before they are unflipped.

Each time the user flips a card, the moves-counter under the memory game board will increase by 1.

When the user has found all 6 card pairs, an alert will pop-up with the message "Congratulations" You found all matches!". When the user clicks OK in the alert window, it will be closed and the user can start a new game by clicking the button "New Game". To avoid accidential restarts, the user will need to confirm that a new game should start. 

When the user confirms, all cards will be flipped back so that the images are no longer visible, shuffled, and the moves-counter will be reset to 0.

The footer area contains a Share-button that opens a news feed window on Facebook, showing a preview of the game and the link to the game.

## Future Features

While the current version is fully functional, there are some ideas for future development:

- Add more cards to increase difficulty level
- Let user choose difficulty level
- Let user choose different topics for the front cards
- Add sound effect when the user wins a game
- Add possibility for the user to save the score

## Typography and color scheme

The color scheme was selected as it is calm and doesn't distract the user from the images that shall be matched. 

Typography was selected due to its playful character.

Font used: "Indie Flower" from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
